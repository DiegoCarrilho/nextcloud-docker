# Nextcloud Docker Stack

Securely run your own Nextcloud instance using Docker swarm mode. Jump to [Quick Start](#quick-start) to get started.

## Technical Overview
Use Docker's built-in container orchestrator, [swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) to deploy a simple security and performance-tuned Nextcloud server. In this stack, [linuxserver's Nextcloud](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/nextcloud/) container is at the center of everything. [Traefik proxy](https://github.com/traefik/traefik) sits in front, providing TLS termination, automatic Let's Encrypt certificate issuance and renewal, and security header management. The [Docker Official Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) container provide a more optimized in-memory cache to accelerate Nextcloud. The [Docker Official MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb) container provides a scalable database to handle multiple users, large numbers of files, and syncing.

## Prerequisites
- Linux (kernel 4.0+ recommended)
- Docker (API version 1.24+)
- GNU Bash
- OpenSSL (for generating passwords)
- Git (for cloning this repo)
- At least 2GB of free disk space to be useful

## Quick Start
These instructions are for setting up a scalable Nextcloud instance at https://nextcloud.example.com. Substitute nextcloud.example.com for your desired subdomain.

1. Find your public IPv4 address by going to https://ipv4.icanhazip.com. Add an A record in your domain's DNS for your desired subdomain. For example, create an A record for `nextcloud` with the value `208.69.38.205` fin the DNS records for zone `example.com`.

2. Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DiegoCarrilho/nextcloud-docker.git
```

3. Start a Docker Swarm. If you have an existing Swarm, skip this step and join it instead.
```bash
docker swarm init
```

4. Run `generate-env.sh` to create your environment configuration, and generate database passwords:
```bash
cd nextcloud-docker
./generate-env.sh nextcloud.example.com
```

5. Set up a DHCP reservation in your router, or a static LAN IP, so you get the same local IP every time. Setup nfs storage for nextcloud "config" and nextcloud_data "data".

6. [Forward ports](https://portforward.com/router.htm) 80 and 443 through your router, to the machine running Docker.

7. Wait 60 seconds and check for your change with a public DNS checker like https://whatsmydns.net or https://dnschecker.org. Confirm your change has propagated to at least most, if not all zones before proceeding.

8. Run `deploy.sh` to apply your configuration and start up the Docker Swarm stack:
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

9. Find the local IP of the machine running Docker, for example `10.0.0.10`, `192.168.1.10`, or if you are running Docker on the machine you're reading this on, `127.0.0.1`. Add this along with your Nextcloud subdomain to your hosts file by running:
```bash
echo "127.0.0.1 nextcloud.example.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

10. Visit your Nextcloud instance in the browser, for example at https://nextcloud.example.com. You may get an insecure site warning, this is OK for now, within a few minutes if your port forward and DNS setup is correct, it will switch to a secure connection.

11. Complete the installation form, with the following information:
- An admin username of your choosing
- An admin password of your choosing
- Storage: `/data`
- Database: `MySQL`
- Database user: `nextcloud-installer`
- Database password: look for MYSQL_USER_PASSWORD in .env
- Database name: `nextcloud`
- Database host: `nextcloud_mariadb`

12. Just after the first 2 lines, add the following to `nextcloud/config/www/nextcloud/config/config.php` :
```
  'memcache.distributed' => '\\OC\\Memcache\\Redis',
  'memcache.locking' => '\\OC\\Memcache\Redis',
  'redis' => array (
    'host' => 'nextcloud_redis',
    'port' => 6379
  ),
  'trusted_proxies' => array (
    0 => '10.0.0.0/16',
  ),
```
13. Try logging in to your Nextcloud instance in the browser again to confirm these changes didn't break it.

14. See if you can reach your Nextcloud instance from the public Internet, using mobile data, or a site like https://downforeveryoneorjustme.com

15. Run the [Nextcloud Security Scan](https://scan.nextcloud.com/), which will confirm Nextcloud is up to date, and all their major recommended security measures are in place.

16. Check your server with [Qualys SSL Labs](https://www.ssllabs.com/) to confirm your HTTPS implementation is secure.

## Updating
An updater script is included, that will get the latest container images for Traefik, Nextcloud, MariaDB, Redis, and immediately update to them. Running this script will cause your Nextcloud instance to be temporarily go offline, usually only about a minute.

To update, open a terminal and run:
```bash
./update.sh
```
After install and first run the scale up is possíble, the session files are now handled by redis and persistent nextcloud file data on NFS.

## Nextcloud Console Command Use
Nextcloud is mostly administered through the web interface, however some tasks must be performed from the Nextcloud Console. If you need to run the `occ` command -

Open a shell into the Nextcloud container:
```bash
./shell.sh
```

Once you enter the shell, you can run commands like:
```bash
occ --version
occ db:add-missing-indicies
```

A list of `occ` commands can be found in the [Nextcloud Documentation of the command](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/stable/admin_manual/configuration_server/occ_command.html) (you should omit `sudo -u www-data php ` - the `./shell.sh` command handles this for you)

## Re-installation / Factory Reset
A script is included to remove all your Nextcloud data and configuration. This may be useful if you mess up your Nextcloud installation, and it gets stuck, and you want to start over. You may also find it useful for development purposes.

**Warning:** Running this will remove all your data. You probably can't recover it. Use with care.

```bash
./purge-data.sh
```
